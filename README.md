# Stock-Scrapper

The aim of this project is to design and develop a database for the customers to get relevant information about stocks and maintain a record of interested stocks. It also maintains customer database as well as stocks’ real-time database. Alerts and updates of subscribed stocks are sent to the customers via their registered emails.

Web scrapping was applied on Google’s search engine and the data was fed into the database on a timely basis.
